# Wiser Integrator

Welcome to the Wiser Integrator project! The goal of this project is to parse EcoSpold and ILCD data sets and integrate them into a graph based on the Wiser Ontology. The Wiser Integrator serves as a powerful tool for organizing and visualizing data from these sources in a structured manner.

## Description
The Wiser Integrator project focuses on extracting relevant information from EcoSpold and ILCD data sets, which are commonly used for environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. By parsing these data sets, the project aims to create a graph representation that aligns with the Wiser Ontology.
